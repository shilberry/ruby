### WIP: Part 1 blog application

This blog is an exploration excerise to understand two new technologies - GraphQL and Relay. We are using standard rails application together with npm for handling front-end dependencies.

It's a work in progress and this repository will update as we move further with this application. The intention is to explore the integration to stage where we can get a clear understanding about these two new technologies and how they might fit in a real world application and framework.
